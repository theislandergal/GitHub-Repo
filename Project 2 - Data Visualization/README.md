This project originated from data set research, I found this data set on the Kaggle website, through the myriad of COVID data I found this one on an animal shelter in Bloomington from 2017 to 2020. 

With over 10,000 lines, I first started focusing on cats and dogs for the span of 1 year (2019), unfortunately that was still way too many lines for the recommended scope so I selected dogs only and with about 8 months, I now have 751 lines. 

I cleared a few useless datapoints and duplciates, which gave me insight on dog names, some quite funny and others quite repetitive and recurring themes in dog naming. 

I also reconfigured the vairous date formats data into an more easily ingested piece of data. 

After critique, I will need to refocus what is the main representation of this data. While I was playing with the table in google Sheets, I navigated through the various stats per columns and got a few interesting information; 
    - Bull breed mix have the highest shelter entrance frequency - 103/751 (13.72%)
    - The age Median is 1.5 years, meaning that 50% is same or smaller than that age, making young dogs the most frequent in shelters, usually due to incompatibilty of lifestyle with owner which also makes of for 13% of the intake reasons in shelters.
    - 64% of the dogs in the span of 8 months represented were adopted. 
    - Only 5 dogs had to be euthanized in shelter. 1 of them was a Husky that bit a human and was at risk of having rabies. 

From that, I'd say, I'd like to clearly represent that most dogs are young dogs, but that even so, the grand majority of them were adopted and were able to grow up in loving households.
