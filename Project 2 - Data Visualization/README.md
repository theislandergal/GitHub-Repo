This project originated from data set research, I found this data set on the Kaggle website, through the myriad of COVID data I found this one on an animal shelter in Bloomington from 2017 to 2020. 

With over 10,000 lines, I first started focusing on cats and dogs for the span of 1 year (2019), unfortunately that was still way too many lines for the recommended scope so I selected dogs only and with about 8 months, I now have 750 lines. 

I cleared a few useless data and duplciates, which gave me insight on dog names, some quite funny and others quite repetitive and recurring themes in dog naming. 

I also reconfigured the date data into an more easily ingested piece of data.
